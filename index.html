	<h1>PHILOSOPHY</h1>
	<a>This is Yuang Li, an international student from China majoring in Interactive Digital Media at Drexel University. I was born in Suzhou in 1998 then my family moved to Shenzhen when I was 6. Shenzhen locates on the southeastern of China and links to Hongkong. I lived there for 12 years and took all my education there.
	Studying abroad is a very important decision for me and my family. We made the decision when I was senior in middle school.
	I took 3-year's high school in the international department sponsored by a public high school. I have been through both Chinese high school's education (courses like Math, Physics, Chinese Literacy, etc.) and United States' high school's education. (courses like Natural Science, Social Science, Humanity, etc.) 
	I also have tried and accomplished some my personal interests and activities in my life. I enjoy doing the pencil sketching, playing saxophone and attend many different kinds of activities related. I joined our high school's TV station and did video editing via Vegas Pro there. I always enjoy sports and try to be better. I found our high school American Football club and joined a team in the city playing against other football lovers. I practiced and learned some of my skills like photoshopping, choosing BGM, via those advertising activities.</a>

  				<h1>GMAP260 Digital Game Project</h1><a>A digital game group project. We made a game that resembled Atari’s 1979 Asteroids but create a new way to play. The Game controls randomly change in the beginning
				of every level, which is 40 seconds per level. The key swaps will occurs at the end of each round. We used GameMaker for game mechanic and 2D Artwork for visual element. Together, we designed the user interface, animated elements, game mechanics, etc. The game's trailer is down here. Feel free to view it.</a>

				<h1>IDM211 User Interface Design Project</h1><a>For my user interface class  final project, I redesigned the gaming interface of Age of Empires II, which is one of the greatest strategy game all time. I redesigned the title page, menu page, gaming interface page and added many new elements like icons, navigation bar and decoration. I kept the original style of the interface but changed the colorway from earthy yellow to navy blue. I redrew some of the icons and also kept some classic ones. My objective is to make the interface better visually appealing and functionality. You can click the link down here to try the wireframe: </a>

  				<h1>DIGM100 Self-Portrait Poster</h1><a>My initial idea is to create a B-movie poster using my self portrait as a main subject. I drew my portrait by using Adobe Illustrator, which I took a picture first and use pen tool drew upon it. The theme of the poster is the superpower of the dictator. I designed the art text "BOW DOWN" and the clip art at the bottom, which are used to reveal the misery of their life under a autocratic country.</a>
